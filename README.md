In this project, we are predicting the weather and soil condition of a particular farm considering various agro-climatic factors. 
This also warns you the possibilities of various pests that might occur in the farm areas, prevent crop failure and maximise crop yield. 
This project works with the principle that Prevention is better than cure.
